INSTALLATION AND RUNNING
To run the code, make sure you have python3 (checked for python3.6) and
ipython. The main
file is tire_new.py, and the main procedure is alltire(). Tune all the
global parameters in globals.py and then run your ipython or python. From
ipython, compile the code
> %run tire_new
and then run the main routine
> alltire()
if everything is fine, the directory should immediately start filling with
files like tireout..png and tireout..dat containing the snapshots of the
simulation. Also, current total flux (namely, luminosity in L_Edd/4\pi units)
will be writted to "flux.dat".

I have not set the code up without ipython, certain libraries like scipy are
not available then. 

OUTPUTS

So far, it produces multiple structure snapshots "tireout*.dat" containing density, velocity, and energy density as functions of length along the field line. Also, total luminosity is written in "flux.dat" as a function of time. 

POSSIBLE PROBLEMS

As the code produces a lot of individual output files, you may encounter problems with file indexers. Notably, baloo file extractor easily hangs the system, hence it is instructive to turn it off by "balooctl disable" in the session you are running.
