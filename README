To run the code, make sure you have python3 (checked for python3.6) and
ipython. The main
file is tire_new.py, and the main procedure is alltire(). Tune all the
global parameters in globals.py and then run your ipython or python. From
ipython, compile the code
> %run tire_new
and then run the main routine
> alltire()
if everything is fine, the directory should immediately start filling with
files like tireout..png and tireout..dat containing the snapshots of the
simulation. Also, current total flux (namely, luminosity in L_Edd/4\pi units)
will be writted to "flux.dat".

I have not set the code up without ipython, certain libraries like scipy are
not available then.
